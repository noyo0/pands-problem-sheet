# Program finds approximate square root of a given number with Newton-Raphson Method
# Created function "fn_newton" with two arguments; number, display. 
# "number" argument sets the number to calculate with, 
# "display" argument determines if the result is displayed as integer (default:0) or a floating point number (1)
# Program runs until max accuracy is reached;
    # I noticed that while allowing infinite iterations of the square root calculation, python limits the number of digits at 17 so the results are repeating once 17-digit accuracy is achieved.
    # Exploiting this "feature" the program can store results in a container and check current result against previous iteration. 
    # If the two are the same, the result must be the most accurate within this 17-digit restriction and the program can break out of the loop as there is no need to iterate any more.
