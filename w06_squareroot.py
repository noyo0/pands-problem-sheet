# Program finds square root of a given number with Newton's method
# Created function "fn_newton" with three arguments; number, accuracy, display. 
# "number" argument sets the number to calculate with, 
# "accuracy" determines maximum number of digits (default:10), 
# "display" argument determines if the result is displayed as floating point number (default:0) or an integer (1)
# Program runs until max accuracy is reached. This is achieved by comparing results with previously stored results, if the new result is the same as the previous one the program would only repeat the same number so no point iterating any more and store the result as final.
